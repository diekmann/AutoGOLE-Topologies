The following files are present in this branch of the topology:

- `goles/*.xml` are the standardized NML with proposed NSI extensions topology format
- `golesv1/*.owl` are the base files in (deprecated) v1 topology format
- `master.xml` is a proposed bootstrap file for point to domain topologies.
- (`crawler` contains an outdated implementation of the topology crawler )

Note that the master topology file currently points to all the github topologies, but it can point anywhere.
